Description:

For my final project at the University of Miami's Machine Learning course in Spring 2023, I tackled the challenge of estimating body fat percentage for 252 men. The project began data preprocessing, employing outlier removal and feature selection.

I applied a range of regression models—linear regression, random forest, and XGB regressor—followed by a comprehensive performance analysis. The next phase involved algorithm selection and hyperparameter tuning using the auto-Sklearn library, enhancing predictive models.

To elevate the project further, two neural networks were trained, optimizing architecture and hyperparameters with Auto-PyTorch. The final phase explored advanced models like Category Embedding, GATE, NODE, and TabNet using PyTorch Tabular.

In summary, this project showcases a holistic approach, integrating traditional regression models, machine learning algorithms, and neural networks to achieve accurate body fat percentage estimation.
