Description:

For my final project at the University of Miami's Machine Learning course in Spring 2023, I tackled the challenge of estimating body fat percentage for 252 men. The project began data preprocessing, employing outlier removal and feature selection.

I applied a range of regression models—linear regression, random forest, and XGB regressor—followed by a comprehensive performance analysis. The next phase involved algorithm selection and hyperparameter tuning using the auto-Sklearn library, enhancing predictive models.

To elevate the project further, two neural networks were trained, optimizing architecture and hyperparameters with Auto-PyTorch. The final phase explored advanced models like Category Embedding, GATE, NODE, and TabNet using PyTorch Tabular.

In summary, this project showcases a holistic approach, integrating traditional regression models, machine learning algorithms, and neural networks to achieve accurate body fat percentage estimation.

Here's a breakdown of the project into five distinct segments, along with the associated files:

-Part 1:
Cleaned the data by removing outliers and employed the filter method to retain crucial features.
Utilized Linear Regression and Random Forest for predictions on the refined dataset.
Trained an XGB Regressor on the entire dataset and conducted a comparative analysis of the results.
-Part 2:
Leveraged the auto-Sklearn library for algorithm selection and hyperparameter tuning.
-Part 3:
Developed and trained two distinct Neural Networks.
-Part 4:
Employed Auto-PyTorch to optimize both the network architecture and training hyperparameters.
-Part 5:
Utilized PyTorch Tabular and trained models such as Category Embedding, GATE, NODE, and TabNet.
